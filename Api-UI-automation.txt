JMeter--------

how to trigger script and prepare results

create /generate report in jmeter from command line (windows)  from terminal in mac/linux

in windows go to till jmeter bin path then run this command- 
jmeter.bat -n -t "location of testPlanFile.jmx" -l "location of resultFile.csv" -e -o "location of report folder" 

for eg-   jmeter.bat -n -t "D:\jmeter\AAddTestToCycle-practice.jmx" -l "D:\jmeter\result1.csv" -e -o "D:\jmeter\report1.csv"


jmeter.bat -n -t "D:\jmeter\AAddTestToCycle-practice.jmx" -l "D:\jmeter\result3.csv" -e -o D:\jmeter\reports3"


create /generate report in jmeter from GUI
CLick on tools > click on generate HTML report > 
browse result file of respective .jmx testPlan > eg:D:\jmeter\result1.csv
browse user.properties- eg: D:\jmeter\New jmeter\Jmeter\apache-jmeter-5.2.1\bin\user.properties
Browse  empty folder where u want to save report files >  D:\jmeter\reports1

(to generate result file by adding listerner- simple data writer or View result in table browse .csv emptyfile)




https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXFaj0tHK4o
1. How to refer current time stamp in JMeter
2. How to get timestamp in required format
3. How to get shifted time in required format
we can get this by using - function helper > need choose any function like - time, timeshift, threadNum, UUId
then we can give our format in which we want to show our date time -   yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss then > click on generate
it will give syntax:- ${__time(yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss,)}

or we can give this string format- dd-mm-yyyy HH:mm:ss  it generate this syntax- ${__time(dd-mm-yyyy HH:mm:ss

timeshift - we can add the days here or we can minus it from current date
Amount of seconds/minutes/hours/days to add (e.g. P2D : plus two days) (optional) -	P2D  (P2D means it add plus 2 days)
MMM-dd-yyyy  if current date is Mar-12-2021
sytax ${__timeShift(MMM-dd-yyyy,,P2D,,)  then this will be  Mar-14-2021

Amount of seconds/minutes/hours/days to add (e.g. P2D : plus two days) (optional) -	P-2D  (P-2D means it minus 2 days)
MMM-dd-yyyy  if current date is Mar-12-2021
syntax  ${__timeShift(MMM-dd-yyyy,,P-2D,,)}  then this will be  Mar-10-2021
 
===========================
login to jmeter machine
login as root
copy jmx files to jmeter bin folder
delete all csv files inside the csv folder b4 starting of the script
create screen using command Screen -S testrun
now inside screen go to jmeter bin path and run below command to start the script
in windows - jmeter.bat -n -t  <File.jmx> -l <resultFile.csv>
in mac linux-  sh jmeter.sh -n -t <filename.jmx> -l <reportname.jtl>
wait for few sec and check for the errors in summary
if we dont have any error then come out of the screen using keyboard shortcut >>ctrl+A+D
type screen -ls to check all the screen visible
get the screen name
now u are out of the screen to resume to screen again type
screen -R <screenname>
now again u check the log summary of errors
come out of screen and rechck once script is completed
to check logs during the jmeter run 
do tail -f <filename.jtl>
=========================
after completion of script and during run check below
aws 
go to dashboard jmeter and monitor cpu and memory
datadog:
go to dd and check for cpu and memory graphs for riak and connect machines
====================================
once done copy <filename.jtl> file to windows and check the different graphs like
response time, aggregate report, aggregate graph, 
if its fail then check for the response code and in jmeter.log we can check the log error and in datadog also we can check the logs
=============
once done prepare report like below and compare with previous releases

✅ What is Selenium Grid?
- It is Part of Selenium Suite.
- It Provides running multiple tests across different browsers, operating systems, and machines in parallel.
- It has a concept of Hub and Node.
 Hub :  Where you run the Test.Hub Passes Execution to Nodes
 Node :  Where Execution Happens

✅Why we need Selenium Grid?
 1. Multiple tests across different browsers
 2. Parallel Testing
 3. Speed and Decrease Execution Time

✅ How to Setup Selenium Grid?
 🟢Step 1 - Download the Selenium Server
 🟢Step 2 - Run Server as Hub Role
   java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.4.0.jar -role hub
  http://192.168.1.2:4444/grid/console
  http://localhost:4444/grid/console
 🟢Step 3 - Connect Node in Same Network.
  java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role node -hub http://192.168.1.106:4444/grid/register
 🟢Step 4 :  Verify the http://192.168.1.2:4444/grid/console

How to create a properties file

Create a new file inside your java project and name it with .properties extension.

example config.properties

*****How to get data from properties file

Step 1 - Create a object of class Properties class
Properties prop = new Properties();

Step 2 - Create a object of class InputStream
InputStream input = new FileInputStream("location of properties file");

Step 3 - Load Properties file
prop.load(input);

Step 4 - Get values from Properties file
prop.getProperty("browser");

How to set data to properties file

Step 1 - Create a object of class Properties class
Properties prop = new Properties();

Step 2 - Create a object of class OutputStream
OutputStream output = new FileOutputStream("location of properties file");

Step 3 - Set values
prop.setProperty("result", "pass");

Step 4 - Store values in properties file
prop.store(output, "comments");
